# Service-Towers-Placement-Optimization-Algorithms
The Objective of this project is the to optimize the positioning of the service towers to get the maximum coverage , we used 4 optimization techniques in achieving this goal : The Simulated Annealing Algorithm(SA) ,  The  Genetic Algorithm(GA) , The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and The Grey Wolf Optimization(GWO)
